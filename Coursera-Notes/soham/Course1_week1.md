# Notes for week 1 of Course 1

## Deep Learning basics

**Supervised learning**
In supervised learning, you have some input x, and you want to learn a function mapping to some output y through lot of available examples  
Neural Networks are very useful for these purposes  

Types of Neural Networs and there applications

* **Standard Neural Networks**
    Real Estate, Online Advertising, etc.
* **Convolution Neural Networks**
    Image Classification
* **Recurrent Neural Networks**
    For Speech Recognision, Machine Translation

Deep learning is booming in recent years because of vast data availability and improvements in Computing and efficient Algorithms
