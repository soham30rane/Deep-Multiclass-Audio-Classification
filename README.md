## Introduction
This project focuses on developing a robust audio classifier that processes user-provided audio files and accurately identifies the category or class to which the audio belongs.

## Description
This project seeks to create a cutting-edge audio classification system capable of sorting diverse audio inputs, including speech, music, and environmental sounds.  
We used 2 approaches for this project, which are as follows,

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- Transfer learning (YAMNet, ResNet50, EfficientNET )
